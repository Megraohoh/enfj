    <h3>The role of the diplomat | The task of people mastery</h3>
    <p id="summary">Protagonists are <span class="highlights">natural-born leaders</span>, full of <span class="highlights">passion</span> and <span class="highlights">charisma</span>. Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring others to achieve and to do good in the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence, <span class="highlights">Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community</span>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span id="listItemHeading">Tolerant</span> <br>Protagonists are true team players, and they recognize that that means listening to other peoples’ opinions, even when they contradict their own. <br>They admit they don’t have all the answers, and are often receptive to dissent, so long as it remains constructive.</li>
        <li><span id="listItemHeading">Altruistic</span> <br>Uniting these qualities is Protagonists’ unyielding desire to do good in and for their communities, be it in their own home or the global stage. <br>Warm and selfless, Protagonists genuinely believe that if they can just bring people together, they can do a world of good.</li>
        <li><span id="listItemHeading">Natural Leaders </span><br> More than seeking authority themselves, Protagonists often end up in leadership roles at the request of others, cheered on by the many admirers of their strong personality and positive vision.</li>
        <li><span id="listItemHeading">Overly Idealistic</span><br>People with the Protagonist personality type can be caught off guard as they find that, through circumstance or nature, or simple misunderstanding, people fight against them and defy the principles they’ve adopted, however well-intentioned they may be. They are more likely to feel pity for this opposition than anger, and can earn a reputation of naïveté.</li>
        <li><span id="listItemHeading">Fluctuating Self-Esteem </span><br> Protagonists define their self-esteem by whether they are able to live up to their ideals, and sometimes ask for criticism more out of insecurity than out of confidence, always wondering what they could do better. If they fail to meet a goal or to help someone they said they’d help, their self-confidence will undoubtedly plummet.</li>
